# This was a poor choice since cartesian 0, 0, 1 is at a singularity of polar coordinates so phi not well defined.
# coincidentally two things were true: 
#    1) There was a bug in cx.MAGtoMLT where when passed a (3,) array, it interpereted it as three phi values and returned array of three MLT's for each one
#       and only the the first one would appear in the print statement of this test. (the first being phi = 0 since 0, 0, 1 passed)
#    2) The sscweb apparently uses the convention that the zenith 0, 0, 1 has 0 longitude
# thus the MLT's agreed by accident 

# It just so happens np.arctan2(0., 0.) == 0 and sscweb was using the same convention aparently.
# So phi was set to zero anyway as it would be for cartesian 1,0,0, which is why the MLT's agree
